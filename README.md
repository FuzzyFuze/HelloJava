Java Programming Samples

Here's some coding examples in relation to a specific learning outcome for a Tertiary Diploma level Object Oriented Programming assessment.

An excerpt from the assessment scenario guidelines:

"The purpose of the complete project (i.e. all two stages) is to apply object oriented language skills to
the creation of a menu-based Java program. This is the requirement for the second stage of a project
that you will need to complete satisfactorily, in order to be deemed competent for this unit."

"Your task for this stage of the project is: using your established and approved scenario from stage 1,
design the remainder of the program's classes (these will be subclasses of your original class or as
approved by your teacher, which you will now convert into an abstract class), including all attributes,
constructors, and methods; create a driver/tester class and a UserInterface class to test your classes
in an ArrayList. Include a loop that displays a menu which shows all the possible options for the user,
and allows the program to continue until they choose to exit. Draw the class diagrams for all your
classes showing their relationships to one another, and to the UserInterface class."
